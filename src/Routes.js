NOTE:
- not everything and every route we are creating is exposed to every single person who is signing into our application
- some routes are just restricted to administrative use
- some routes are restricted to only signedin users
- It is good idea to show some component to some people and some component to some other people
- so this is route level restriction or restricted routes
- using react-router-dom
